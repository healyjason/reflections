Question When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer I would create a file on a remote repository possibly because I wanted to keep it separate to my local repository for some reason.
Or maybe if I want to share the file with others.
Or maybe if I want others to help me to edit it.
Question Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer Because the changes I make on my remote repository on for example GitHub may be experimental or maybe they involve collaborations
Maybe my offline git repository is working fine so if it always auto updated to be in synch with my remote repository then maybe a contributor or myself may have made changes leading to a bug
It may be of benefit to have two repositories when experimenting or when in development
