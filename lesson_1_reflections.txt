Question How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Answer It compared the two files for differences and
It provided me with a summary
Rather than I having to trawl through the entirety of the two files
Because the two files contained many many lines of code
Such comparison between the two would have been tedious or maybe impossible
Question How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Answer It could mean that if I make an error I could refer back to previous versions
It could also mean I can track how a file has developed over time
Question What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to creat a commit like you do it Git vs having versions automatically saved like Google docs does?
Answer Pros include the fact that I can use my own judgment to know when is the right time to commit
Cons include the fact that auto saving might save too much information too late or too little information too soon
Question Why do you think some version control systems like Git allow saving multiple files in one commit while others like Google Docs treat each file separately
Answer Because when changing multiple interrelated files it makes sense that changes are tracked across them all
And when using unrelated files it is probably not necessary to track changes across them
Question How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files
Answer I can use git log to find all the changes committed or commits and then I can use git diff to compare one commit to the previous or next commit using the commit IDs
Within a git log I can also scroll down through the log if it is not on the screen using the down or enter keys
Question How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something
Answer Using version control means that if I make a change that breaks something I can use git logs git checkout and git diff to roll back to the previous working version and then find out what was changed to the version with the bug
Question Now that you have your workspace set up what do you want to try using Git for
Answer I am not sure but I think I will use Git to track android app development coding
