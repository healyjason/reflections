Question What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Answer I use git init via git bash when I have placed the git bash command line within the relevant repository
Then git bash creates a git repository within that folder
I need to do it because otherwise git will not track the changes in a repository at all
If git is tracking changes this enables me to use version control and to be more efficient at debugging and solving problems between versions
Question How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the repository because the staging area is a temporary location where we can place various files in a group before a final commit to the repository
The staging area is different to the working directory because I can decide to place only some of the files that have been changed in the staging area rather than everything from the working directory
The value of the latter is that it cuts down on the amount of info per commit
The value of the former is that the staging area allows us to set up each commit in groups rather than just single file or all file commits
